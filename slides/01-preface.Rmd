<!--  1. About me
    * NERC Fellow at the university of Sheffield (proto lecturer?)
    * Masters in France (Montpellier - I'm from around there), PhD in Dublin (with Natalie Cooper), Postdocs in Imperial College (near London), Brisbane (Australia), Sheffield.
    * I work on understanding what mechanisms generate and maintain the diversity of traits through time? (but secretly I just like coding and solving stats problems)
