# Morphological_traits
 
## Plan

# 0 - Preface:
 1. About me
    * NERC Fellow at the university of Sheffield (proto lecturer?)
    * Masters in France (Montpellier - I'm from around there), PhD in Dublin (with Natalie Cooper), Postdocs in Imperial College (near London), Brisbane (Australia), Sheffield.
    * I work on 
 2. What are we going to do?
 3. How is it going to work
    * Rmd + slides
 4. Insist in open research + collaboration (links back to About me)

# 1 - Intro :
 1. Why using morphological data? (why not molecular?)
    * Objective vs. subjective: NO + only data available from the past (so there).
 2. What can we do with morphological data?
    * Phylogenetics (Rachel course next week) + PCM (tomorrow + most of the rest of the workshop! Yay!), including disparity
 3. What is disparity?
    * Intro from disparity paper
 4. Our narrative
    * Mammals at the K-Pg

# 2 - From specimens to traitspaces:
 1. Types of morphological data
    * Continuous, gmm, discrete (qualitative, quantitative)
    * Combining this data in a meaningful way for analyses
 2. Missing data and estimating ancestral traits
 3. Ordinations (ordinating or not – traitspace vs. PCA, etc.)

# 3 - From traitspaces to disparity:
 1. Different types of traitspaces
 2. Many many dimensions: breaking physics
    * Multidimensional nightmare
    * Curse of dimensionality
 3. Measuring disparity
    * Choosing the right metric (depending on the question)

# 4 - From disparity to understanding evolutionary biology:
 1. Testing hypothesis with disparity data
 2. Measuring disparity through time
 3. Telling disparity stories

# 5 - Conclusion
 1. Where to go from there?
 2. Don’t listen to (only) me!
 3. What other people have done?
 4. What do you want to do?
